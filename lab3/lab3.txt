<h1 id="Javascript" class="spec"><a name= "Javascript"></a> Javascript</h1>

<p>is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>

<p> JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted scripting language. It is well-known for the development of web pages, 
many non-browser environments also use it. 
JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments.
 JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, 
 and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.</p>
 
 
<h2 id="History" class="spec"><a name= "History"></a> History</h2>

<p>The first web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people,
 it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.
 The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994.
 This quickly became the most-used.
During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. 
There was a desire in the burgeoning web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator.
 They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language,
 while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.</p>
